# WindowCreator is in a very early state, everything is subject to change.

WindowCreator is a python utility made to eliminate the need for a virtual machine to get an image of a error box. 
It will also be able to work as a python library for making crazy error videos.

In its current state, its just a function dump where you have to go to the end of the file and put what window generating function you want. There are examples in the comments at the bottom, just uncomment any line and see the result.
